# List-based FIFO queue
Implementation of FIFO queue based on XOR linked list from previous project.
The queue is a data structure that uses list and provides functions corresponding to the following commands:
* PUSH N - add element N to the end of the queue.
* POP - remove the first element from the queue.
* PRINT_QUEUE - print the queue from the first element to the lastly added.
* COUNT - the number of elements in queue â‰¤ SIZE.
* GARBAGE_SOFT - change the values of all elements of the list that do not belong to the queue to 0.
* GARBAGE_HARD - remove all elements from the list that does not belong to the queue.
